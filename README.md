# Jenkins ingest

https://app.moderne.io allows users to run recipes against thousands of Open Source Software projects.
This repository contains a comma separated value (CSV) file of repositories to ingest into Moderne on a daily basis.

## How to add/update the Java OSS repositories of new/existing GH org/user

Open [this workflow](https://github.com/moderneinc/jenkins-ingest/actions/workflows/addGitHubOrganization.yaml) 
and introduce the GitHub username or organization that you would like to add in our Moderne public tenant.  

If you are using a fork of this repository, you need to create a classic Personal Access Token (PAT) (fine-grained tokens 
are invalid) with `repo` scope. The secret needs to be called `PAT`.

This will create a pull request with all the Java repositories entries. Feel free to change 
the entries you want to remove or customize.

It is important to validate if those repositories are using a Maven or Gradle wrapper, because
if they are not, it could be that: (1) they are not using a build tool and they need to be skipped, 
or (2) it is necessary to select the specific Maven or Gradle versions tools installed 
in our Jenkins instance.

After the pull request is merged, a new process to update our Jenkins instance will be triggered.

See the next section to understand the columns and accepted values.

## repos.csv file format
The CSV file can use an optional header row.
```csv
repoName,branch,javaVersion,style,buildTool,buildAction,skip,skipReason
```

The columns are defined as follows:

| Column          | Required | Notes                                                                                             |
|-----------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| scmHost         | Optional | Repository host such as `github.com`, `gitlab.com` or enterprise hosts. Defaults to `github.com`. |
| repoName        | Required | Repository path with form `organization/name`, i.e. `google/guava`.                               |
| repoBranch      | Optional | Git branch name to ingest. Defaults to `main`.                                                       |
| mavenTool       | Optional | Name of the Maven Global Tool Configuration to use. Defaults to `maven`, which corresponds to 3.3.8. Other values are `maven3.x` (3.8.6) and `maven3.3.9`|
| gradleTool      | Optional | Name of the Gradle Global Tool Configuration to use. Defaults to `gradle`, which corresponds to 7.6.1. Other values are `gradle 7.4.2`                        |
| jdkTool         | Optional | Name of the JDK Global Tool Configuration to use. If there are no values, is `java8`.             |
| repoStyle       | Optional | Name of the OpenRewrite style to apply during ingest. Defaults to empty.                          |
| repoBuildAction | Optional | Additional build tool tasks/targets to execute before ingestion goal. Defaults to empty.          |
| repoSkip        | Optional | Use 'TRUE' to omit ingest job creation for the CSV row. Defaults to empty.                        |
| skipReason      | Optional | Reason a job is set to skip.                                                                      |

## Creating Jenkins jobs
The Jenkins ingestion jobs are created from `repos.csv` by running the moderne-cli command `moderne-cli connect jenkins`
either on a local machine, or through GitHub Actions on the `moderne-cli` repository.

## Upload `maven/ingest-settings.xml`
Ingestion can optionally use a Maven settings file to configure authentication for private repositories.
An example of which is given in `maven/ingest-settings.xml`.
This file should be configured in Jenkins master through `Manage Jenkins > Global Tool Configuration > Maven Configuration`.

## Adding repositories from your local machine
To add a repository to the ingestion process, add a row to `repos.csv` with the repository name and branch.

```shell
$ ./add-github-organization.sh openrewrite
```

Then trigger a manual run of https://github.com/moderneinc/moderne-cli/actions/workflows/jenkins.yml to create the Jenkins jobs, potentially with a prefix filter.
After the jobs have run once, you might want to update or skip failed jobs through the parser.

## Parser

Updates `repos.csv` based on a `org.openrewrite.FindBuildToolFailures` Data table CSV export.

## Usage

1. Run https://public.moderne.io/recipes/org.openrewrite.FindBuildToolFailures on a set of repositories, _without output log_.
2. Download the Data table `Build tool failures` CSV.
3. Run the parser:
```shell
./gradlew build && java -jar build/libs/jenkins-ingest-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar repos.csv  ~/Downloads/FRfzi.csv
```
4. Commit the changed `repos.csv`.
5. Trigger the [Moderne-CLI workflow](https://github.com/moderneinc/moderne-cli/actions/workflows/jenkins.yml) to update Jenkins jobs.
